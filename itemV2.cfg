description = "Replaces the pig with one of the squig variants from Totalwarhammer 2.\nCurrently the ragdoll is not properly setup so you will see weird things happen when the squig is killed. And everyone in the party will probably need the mod enabled to prevent crashing. Otherwise if you experience any crashes let me know and please include your most recent console log, found at C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Fatshark\Vermintide 2\console_logs \n\nAll the animations, textures, and the model for the squig were taken from Totalwarhammer 2.
